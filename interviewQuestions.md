# Front-end Job Interview Questions

This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

## JS Questions:
---
### ----- Explain event delegation: ----- 
> DOM event delegation is a mechanism of responding to ui-events via a single common parent rather than each child, through the magic of event "bubbling" (aka event propagation).

```javascript
document.getElementById("parent-list").addEventListener("click", function(e) {
	// e.target is the clicked element!
	// If it was a list item
	if(e.target && e.target.nodeName == "LI") {
		// List item found!  Output the ID!
		console.log("List item ", e.target.id.replace("post-", ""), " was clicked!");
	}
});
```
* Regarding HTML, add an event listener (such as a click) to the parent element of similar children
* The event will "Bubble UP" when event (clicking) is triggered by the child element
* e.target will indicate which child element has been triggered, thus use an if/else if perform that specific task

### ----- Explain how `this` works in JavaScript: ----- 
  * "This" refers to the **execution context**, or where (the scope) the code is currently executing
  * Four types of "this":
    * **Calling an Objects method**: when executing an objects method, the "this" keyword provides useful
    * **Constructor**: when using the NEW keyword, an object can set its own properties using "this"
    * **Function call or Global**: when refering to "this" it will reference the most global object, usually window
    * **Event Handler**:
      * An inline event handler will refer to the **window** object
      ```javascript
      <script type="text/javascript"> 
        function click_handler() { 
          alert(this); // alerts the window object 
        } 
      </script>
      <button id='thebutton' onclick='click_handler()'>Click me!</button>
      ```
      * However, adding an event with javascript "this" refers to the DOM element
      ```javascript
      <script type="text/javascript"> 
        function click_handler() { 
          alert(this); // alerts the button DOM node 
        } 
        
        function addhandler() { 
          document.getElementById('thebutton').onclick = click_handler; 
        } 
        
        window.onload = addhandler; 
      </script>
      <button id='thebutton'>Click me!</button>
      ```

  >In typical object-oriented programming, we need a way of identifying and referring to the object that weâ€™re currently working with. "this" serves the purpose admirably, providing our objects the ability to examine themselves, and point at their own properties.

### ----- Explain how prototypal inheritance works: -----
* Every object has a property called **prototype**
  * this is a pointer to another object
  * when setting a method protoype on an object, it puts that method on the pointer object
  * when invoking that method, it looks up the prototype chain, if it is not an object's property, it will look to the prototype object and invoke it with the context of "this" of the object
* **Regarding inheritance**
  * If an object is created, it inherits its protype methods from its parent. That way each new object does not need to have its own method. It can look up the prototype chain to the parent and use that method. It is VERY performant.

### ----- What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS? -----

###### Common.js
```javascript
// Exporting --> note: no default export, will break
exports.myMethod = (word) => console.log(word)

// Now import the above into another folder
const importedMethods = require('./filename.js')
importedMethods.myMethod('Hello, World!') 
```
###### AMD - Asynchronous Module Defenition
```javascript
define(['dep1', 'dep2'], function (dep1, dep2) {

  //Define the module value by returning a value.
  return function () {};
});
```
* Simplicity: CommonJS
* Async: RequireJS (AMD) and Node (Better loading times)
* Note: Both seem to be on their way out, Node is now asynchronous and with SPA's becoming more popular webpack is on the rise opening the door for **ES6 modules**
* SystemJS? All-in-one

### Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`, What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?
```javascript
function () {}; // just a declaration, so it cant be invoked
(function() {}); // expression, returns a function, so it can be invoked
(function() {})();
```

### What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?
--- **undeclared** ---
* doesn't use var keyword
* gets created on the window, operates in different space than declared
* find it, use strict mode

--- **undefined** ---
* variable that has not been defined yet, may have been defined
* when attempting to use a variable that is undefined it will throw an error; also use (typeof varname === "undefined")

-- **null** --
* variable has been declared, and set to null. points to location in memory, but there is nothing there
